## Desperados: Wanted Dead or Alive parser

This project contains a simple parser for a very limited subset of the game *Desperados: Wanted Dead or Alive* files. It is written in Ruby and uses the BinData library.

At the moment the only feature is parsing of the *Profiles* file located in *\<install dir\>\Game\Data\Savegame\Profiles*. The parser was written for playing with the game resolution and this was the only feature needed. I don't expect to add any more features or updates whatsoever. However, you can always contact me and try your luck :-)

#### Usage
The **main.rb** file in the parser directory contains all code. Run it with `ruby main.rb`. Of course, remember to run `bundle install` first.
